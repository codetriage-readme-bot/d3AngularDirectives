# d3AngularDirectives

This repository gives you the directives written in angular for various d3 visualizations.

## How to Use:
Directives are added inside the folder Directives/Charts.Call the directive name in the view and bind the data. 

## Samples:
I have created two samples using the existing directives for
- sunburst
- force visualization.
